# Architecture Overview

> **Document ID:** 1B  
> **Document purpose**  
> This document provides a high-level architectural overview of the solution, describing major components, interactions, and design principles.  
> It is intended for internal engineering, architecture, and technical stakeholders.

This document bridges conceptual understanding and detailed architectural diagrams.
