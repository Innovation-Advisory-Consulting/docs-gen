# Vulnerability and Patch Management

> **Document ID:** 5E  
> **Document purpose**  
> This document describes how vulnerabilities are identified, tracked, prioritized, and remediated within the solution, including patching practices for dependencies and infrastructure.  
> It is intended for internal engineering, security, and operations stakeholders.

This document supports proactive security maintenance and risk reduction.

---

## 1. Overview

This document describes vulnerability and patch management practices used to maintain security posture over time.

Vulnerability sources may include:
- dependency scanning
- infrastructure scanning
- penetration testing
- threat intelligence
- internal security reviews

---

## 2. Vulnerability identification

Describe how vulnerabilities are identified.

- {{Dependency scanning}}
- {{Static analysis}}
- {{Container or image scanning}}
- {{Infrastructure scanning}}
- {{Manual review}}

If scanning is not implemented, state **Vulnerability scanning not implemented**.

---

## 3. Vulnerability tracking

Describe how vulnerabilities are tracked.

- **Tracking system:** {{Ticketing / spreadsheet / unknown}}
- **Ownership model:** {{Assigned to component owners / centralized / unknown}}
- **Reporting cadence:** {{Frequency}}

---

## 4. Severity classification

Describe how vulnerabilities are categorized.

| Severity | Definition | Expected response |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Critical | {{Definition}} | {{Response expectation}} |
| High | {{Definition}} | {{Response expectation}} |
| Medium | {{Definition}} | {{Response expectation}} |
| Low | {{Definition}} | {{Response expectation}} |

If severity classification is not standardized, state **Severity classification not standardized**.

## 5. Patch management workflow

Describe patching workflow.

1. {{Vulnerability detected}}
2. {{Ticket created and assigned}}
3. {{Impact analysis}}
4. {{Patch applied}}
5. {{Testing performed}}
6. {{Deployment scheduled}}
7. {{Closure and verification}}

---

## 6. Dependency patching

Describe how third-party dependencies are patched.

- {{Dependency update cadence}}
- {{Automated upgrade tooling}}
- {{Regression testing requirements}}

Reference the Dependency Inventory where applicable.

---

## 7. Infrastructure patching

Describe how infrastructure is patched.

- {{Operating system patching}}
- {{Cloud service patching responsibilities}}
- {{Runtime platform patching}}

---

## 8. Emergency patching process

Describe emergency patching approach.

- {{Critical vulnerability response}}
- {{Out-of-band release process}}
- {{Communication expectations}}

---

## 9. Verification and validation

Describe how patch success is verified.

- {{Re-scanning after patch}}
- {{Test suite validation}}
- {{Operational monitoring}}

---

## 10. Exceptions and risk acceptance

Describe how exceptions are handled.

- {{Temporary exception process}}
- {{Risk acceptance authority}}
- {{Documentation requirements}}

---

## 11. Assumptions and open items

### Assumptions
- {{Assumption}}
- {{Assumption}}

### Open items / TODOs
- {{Scanning coverage incomplete}}
- {{Patch SLA not defined}}

---

## 12. Summary

This document describes how vulnerabilities are identified and patched to support security, reliability, and operational integrity.

It should be reviewed regularly as part of release and governance processes.
